# BUSPaS repository
Comparative study of BUSPaS against MCTS4DM and Beam Search for supervised local pattern mining (e.g. Subgroup Discovery, Exceptional Model Mining and Exceptional Preferences Mining).

Instructions upon retrieving the data are presented in BUSPaS/Data/README.md .

The folder's "Code>BUSPaS" "Code>MCTS4DM" and "Code>BeamSearch" contain search strategy specific code and a jupyter notebook with examples of how to use the algorithms.
The folder "Code>Experiments - Benchmark Datasets" and "Code>Experiments - Synthetic" contain files that show the experiments, EX.X shows the experiment ERX.X shows how the results are retrieved and analyzed.

- E1.1 and E1.2 contain the sensitivity analysis describe in the appendix of the paper.
- E4 contains the comparison of the algorithms on data that we did not generate ourselves.
- E2 contains the comparison of the algorithms on synthetic data.
